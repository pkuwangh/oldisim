Usage: ${0##*/} [-h] [-t experiment time] [-s scan arguments] -- driver command
Finds the maximum QPS that satisfies a latency target.
Algorithm to find QPS for latency target adapted from Jacob Leverich\'s
mutilate (EuroSys \'14) [https://github.com/leverich/mutilate]

    -h          display this help and exit
    -t          amount of time to run each experiment in seconds
    -s          metric:target (in msec). Example: 99p:5.01. Allowable metrics
                are avg, 50p, 90p, 95p, 99p, 99.9p
